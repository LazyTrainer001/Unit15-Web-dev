## Introduction 

This project is focused on the creation of a website for a company called hot beans web, 
the company focuses on website development and I have been tasked with creating a website
that introuduces some members of staff and gives users an opportunity to apply to work at the company.
Furthermore I have also been tasked with providing information and links to courses that can
teach users about website development as a part of this website.
